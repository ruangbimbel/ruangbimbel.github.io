The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence Indonesians celebrate their country's Independence Day on August 17. The proclamation of Indonesian Independence took place on August 17, 1945. This is a historical moment. On August 12, 1945, Soekarno, Hatta, and Dr. Radjiman went to Dalat near Saigon to meet with the Japanese commander. In the meeting, Japan planned to grant Indonesian Independence. On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered, and the Japanese authorities in the East Indies were ordered to maintain the status quo pending the arrival of Allied forces. However, there was no official confirmation from the Japanese of the surrender. Soekarno and Hatta went to Yamamoto office to get the confirmation, but the office was empty. Then Ahmad Soebardjo went to meet Tadashi Maeda to ask about the surrender rumours, and received unofficial confirmation that the rumour was true. Hatta then asked Ahmad Soebardjo to arrange a meeting of the PPKI for the following day and went home to draft a proclamation. However, a group of youths, Wikana, Soebadio, Chaerul Saleh, Soekarni, Adam Malik, Darwis, and Soeroto Kunto went to Soekarno's house on Pegangsaan. Wikana demanded an immediate proclamation of independence in person, rather than through PPKI. Soekarno entrefused to do so as besides the need to discuss matters with the PPKI, he did not want to provoke the Japanese. Hatta subsequently arrived and took the same stance as Soekarno, and pointed out that there was still no official confirmation of the Japanese surrender. On August 16, 1945 at 3 a.m. the youths went to Soekarno's house again. They took Soekarno and Hatta to the town of Rengasdengklok. They forced them to declare independence as soon as possible. However, Soekarno and Hatta still refused. Later that morning, Maeda learned that Soekarno and Hatta had disappeared. An army investigation led to Wikana, who was pressured to return the two men to Jakarta. Then Kunto and Ahmad Soebardjo went to Rengasdengklok to pick up Soekarno and Hatta. On August 16, 1945 about 8 p.m. they arrived at Soekarno's house. Around midnight Soekarno and Hatta went to Maeda's house. There had been some people, such as Tampak Latuharhary, Otto Iskandardinata, Teuku Mohammad Hasan, and the youths such as Chaerul Saleh, Soekarni, B.M. Diah, and Sayuti Melik. Soekarno and Hatta created the declaration of independence. There was a debate about who would sign the proclamation text. Finally, they decided that Soekarno and Hatta signed the proclamation text. Soekarni stated that the proclamation text should be read in Ikada Field because they had announced people to gather there. However, the idea was rejected by Soekarno because they didn't want to cause an incident. Finally, Soekarno decided that the proclamation would be read at his house on Pegangsaan Timur Street 56 at 10 a.m. The proclamation text was typed by Sayuti Melik.​</a>

                                            The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence Indonesians celebrate their country's independence Day on August 17. The proclamation of Indonesian Independence took place on August 17, 1945. This is a historical moment. On August 12, 1945, Soekamo, Hatta, and Dr. Radjiman went to Dalat near Saigon to meet with the Japanese commander in the meeting. Japan planned to grant Indonesian Independence. On August 15, 1945 Japan buirender and Use Jaciarse authorities in the East Indies were ordered to maintain the status quo pending the arrival of allied forces. However, there was no official confirmation from the Japanese of the surrender. Soekamo and Hatta went to Yamamoto office to get the confirmation, but the office was empty. Then Ahmad Soebardjo went to meet Tadashi Maeda to ask about the surrender rumours, and received unofficial confirmation that the rumour was true. Hatta then asked Ahmad Soebardjo to arrange a meeting of the PPKI for the following day and went home to draft a proclamation. However, a group of youths, Wikana. Soebadio, Chaerul Saleh, Soekami, Adam Malik, Darwis, and Soeroto Kunto went to Soekamo's house on Pegangsaan. Wikana demanded an immediate proclamation of independence in person, rather than through PPKI. Soekamo refused to do so as besides the need to discuss matters with the PPKI, he did not want to provoke the Japanese. Hatta subsequently arrived and took the same stance as Soekamo, and pointed out that there was still no official confirmation of the Japanese surrender. On August 16, 1945 at 3 a.m. the youths went to Soekamo's house again. They took Soekarno and Hatta to the town of Rengasdengklok. They forced them to declare independence as soon as possible. However, Soekamo and Hatta still refused. Later that morning, Maeda leamed that Soekarno and Hatta had disappeared. An Army investigation led to Wikana, who was pressured to return the two men to Jakarta. Then Kunto and Ahmad Soebardjo went to Rengasdengklok to pick Soekamo and Hatta On August 16, 1945 about 8 p.m. they arrived at Soekarno's house. Around midnight Soekarnó and Hatta went to Maeda's house. There had been some people, such as Tampak Latuharhary, Otto Iskandardinata. Teuku Mohammad Hasan, and the youths such as Chaerul Saleh, Soekami, B.M. Diah, and Sayuti Melik. Soekarno and Hatta created the declaration of independence. There was a debate about who would sign the proclamation text. Finally, they decided that Soekamo and Hatta signed the proclamation text. Soekarni stated that the proclamation text should be read in Ikada Field because they had announced people to gather there. However, the idea was rejected by Soekamo because they didn't want to cause an incident. Finally, Soekarno decided that the proclamation would be read at his house on Pegangsaan Timur 56 at 10 a.m. The proclamation text was typed by Sayuti Melik On August 17, 1945 at 10 a.m. many people were worried because Hatta hadn't come yet. Five minutes later. Hatta came and people welcomed Soekarno and Hatta cheerfully. The ceremony was very simple. Soekarno with Hatta by his side, read the proclamation of Indonesian Independence. PETA officer, Latief Hendraningat, raised the red and white flag of Indonesia and the attendees sung the Indonesian national anthem, Indonesia Raya. The flag was sewed by Fatmawati, Soekarno's wife.

                                            The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence Indonesians celebrate their country's independence Day on August 17. The proclamation of Indonesian Independence took place on August 17, 1945. This is a historical moment. On August 12, 1945, Soekamo, Hatta, and Dr. Radjiman went to Dalat near Saigon to meet with the Japanese commander in the meeting. Japan planned to grant Indonesian Independence. On August 15, 1945 Japan buirender and Use Jaciarse authorities in the East Indies were ordered to maintain the status quo pending the arrival of allied forces. However, there was no official confirmation from the Japanese of the surrender. Soekamo and Hatta went to Yamamoto office to get the confirmation, but the office was empty. Then Ahmad Soebardjo went to meet Tadashi Maeda to ask about the surrender rumours, and received unofficial confirmation that the rumour was true. Hatta then asked Ahmad Soebardjo to arrange a meeting of the PPKI for the following day and went home to draft a proclamation. However, a group of youths, Wikana. Soebadio, Chaerul Saleh, Soekami, Adam Malik, Darwis, and Soeroto Kunto went to Soekamo's house on Pegangsaan. Wikana demanded an immediate proclamation of independence in person, rather than through PPKI. Soekamo refused to do so as besides the need to discuss matters with the PPKI, he did not want to provoke the Japanese. Hatta subsequently arrived and took the same stance as Soekamo, and pointed out that there was still no official confirmation of the Japanese surrender. On August 16, 1945 at 3 a.m. the youths went to Soekamo's house again. They took Soekarno and Hatta to the town of Rengasdengklok. They forced them to declare independence as soon as possible. However, Soekamo and Hatta still refused. Later that morning, Maeda leamed that Soekarno and Hatta had disappeared. An Army investigation led to Wikana, who was pressured to return the two men to Jakarta. Then Kunto and Ahmad Soebardjo went to Rengasdengklok to pick Soekamo and Hatta On August 16, 1945 about 8 p.m. they arrived at Soekarno's house. Around midnight Soekarnó and Hatta went to Maeda's house. There had been some people, such as Tampak Latuharhary, Otto Iskandardinata. Teuku Mohammad Hasan, and the youths such as Chaerul Saleh, Soekami, B.M. Diah, and Sayuti Melik. Soekarno and Hatta created the declaration of independence. There was a debate about who would sign the proclamation text. Finally, they decided that Soekamo and Hatta signed the proclamation text. Soekarni stated that the proclamation text should be read in Ikada Field because they had announced people to gather there. However, the idea was rejected by Soekamo because they didn't want to cause an incident. Finally, Soekarno decided that the proclamation would be read at his house on Pegangsaan Timur 56 at 10 a.m. The proclamation text was typed by Sayuti Melik On August 17, 1945 at 10 a.m. many people were worried because Hatta hadn't come yet. Five minutes later. Hatta came and people welcomed Soekarno and Hatta cheerfully. The ceremony was very simple. Soekarno with Hatta by his side, read the proclamation of Indonesian Independence. PETA officer, Latief Hendraningat, raised the red and white flag of Indonesia and the attendees sung the Indonesian national anthem, Indonesia Raya. The flag was sewed by Fatmawati, Soekarno's wife.

                                            The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence The proclamation of Indonesian independence was read at 10.00 a.m. on Friday, 17  August 1945. The declaration marked the start of the diplomatic and armed resistance of  the Indonesian National Revolution, fighting against the forces of the Netherlands and pro Dutch civilians, until the latter officially acknowledged Indonesia's independence in 1949.  In 2005, the Netherlands declared that they had decided to accept de facto 17 August 1945  as Indonesia's independence date. In a 2013 interview the Indonesian historian Sukotjo,  amongst others, asked the Dutch government to formally acknowledge the date of  independence as 17 August 1945. The United Nations, who mediated in the conflict,  formally acknowledge the date of independence as 27 December 1949.  The document was signed by Sukarno (who signed his name "Soekarno" using the older  Dutch orthography) and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed president and vice president respectively the following day.  The draft was prepared only a few hours earlier, on the night of 16 August, by Sukarno,  Hatta, and Soebardjo, at Rear-Admiral Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi's house, Miyako-Doori 1,  Jakarta (now the "Museum of the Declaration of Independence", JL. Imam Bonjol I, Jakarta).  The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik. Maeda  himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agreeable to the idea of Indonesia's  independence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. Marshal Terauchi,  the highest-ranking Japanese leader in South East Asia and son of Prime Minister Terauchi  Masatake, was however against Indonesia's independence, scheduled for 24 August. While the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself for  that matter, had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date  was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional  surrender to the Allies on 15 August following the Nagasaki atomic bombing. The historic  event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists such as Adam Malik  and Chairul Saleh, that’s put pressure on Sukarno and Hatta to proclaim independence  immediately. The declaration was to be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory  Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new  nation's diversity. The particular act was apparently inspired by a similar spirit of the  United States Declaration of Independence. However, the idea was heavily turned down by  the radical activists mentioned earlier, arguing that the committee was too closely  associated with then soon to be defunct Japanese occupation rule, thus creating a potential  credibility issue. Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them  were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed  on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co signers in the name of the nation of Indonesia. Sukarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada Plain, the large open  field in the centre of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread apprehension over the  possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venue was changed to Sukarno's house at Pegangsaan  Timur 56. There was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had  already surrendered to the Allies, the declaration of independence passed without a hitch. The proclamation at 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur, Jakarta, was heard throughout the  country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku radio station. An English translation of the  proclamation was broadcast overseas. Questions  4.  Write the social function of the text above! 5. What happened on 17 August 1945? 6.

                                            The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence The proclamation of Indonesian independence was read at 10.00 a.m. on Friday, 17 August 1945. The document was signed by Sukarno (who signed his name "Soekarno" using the older Dutch orthography) and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed as president and vice-president respectively the following day. The draft was prepared only a few hours earlier, on the night of 16 August, by Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo, at Rear-Admiral Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi's house, Jalan Imam Bonjol I, Jakarta. The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik. Maeda agreed to the idea of Indonesia's independence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. While the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional surrender to the Allies on 15 August. The historic event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists such as Adam Malik and Chairul Saleh, that put pressure on Sukarno and Hatta to proclaim independence immediately. The declaration must be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new nation's diversity. Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co-signers in the name of the nation of Indonesia. Sukarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada plain, the large open field in the centre of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread apprehension over the possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venue was changed to Sukarno's house at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur 56 Jakarta. There was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had already surrendered to the Allies, The declaration of independence passed without a hitch. The proclamation at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur 56 Jakarta was heard throughout the country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku radio station. An English translation of the proclamation was broadcast overseas. 6. What is the text about? 7.

The news was kept secret by the Japanese army in Indonesia, but Sutan Syahrir, the youth of Indonesia, knew it through the BBC Radio Broadcasts in London on August 15,1945. At the same time, Ir. Soekarno and Drs. Moh Hatta returned to the Indonesia from Saigon, Vietnam.        On August 15, at 8 p.m., under the leadership of Chairul Saleh, younger groups and older groups gathered in the backroom Bacteriologi Laboratory which located in Jalan Pegangsaaan Timur number 13, Jakarta. The younger group argued that Indonesia must declared their independence immediately. But the older group didn’t agree that. Because of that, independence should be discussed on PPKI meeting on August 18, 1945.        Because there was a different opinion between older groups and younger groups, younger groups brought Soekarno and Hatta to Rengasdengklok in early morning of August 16, 1945. Rengasdengklok was chosen because it was located away from Jakarta. Yonger groups tried to push Soekarno and Hatta to declare Indonesia Independence        After had a long discussion, Soekarno was willing to declare it after returning to Jakarta. At that moment in Jakarta, Wikana from younger groups and Ahmad Soebarjo from older groups made a negotiations. The results was that the declaration of Indonesia Independence should be held in Jakarta. In addition, Tadashi Maeda allowed his place for negotiations and he was willing to guarantee their safety. Finally, Soekarno and Hatta were picked from Rengasdengklok.        Text of Proclamation of Indonesia Independence formulated by Soekarno, Hatta, and Ahmad Subarjo. Once the text was completed and approved, Sajuti Melik then copied and typed the manuscript used a typewriter.        At first Proclamation of Indonesia Independence would be read at Ikala Field. But looked at the road to the Ikada Field was guarded by japanese army. Finally they moved to residence of Soekarno at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur number 56 Jakarta.        On the day of Friday, August 17 1945, Soekarno read the Proclamation of Indonesia Independence text and then connected with a short speech without text. After that, Latif Hendra Ningrat and Soehoed was fluttering the flag which had sewn by Mrs. Fatmawati. Then audience sang Indonesia Raya song together.

                            5. 1. Work individually! 2. From the title, what is your prediction about the content? Read the text carefully! 3. The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence Indonesians celebrate their country's Independence Day on August 17. The proclamation of Indonesian Independence took place on August 17, 1945. This is a historical moment. On August 12, 1945, Soekarno, Hatta, and Dr. Radjiman went to Dalat near Saigon to meet with the Japanese commander. In the meeting, Japan planned to grant Indonesian Independence. On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered, and the Japanese authorities in the East Indies were ordered to maintain the status quo pending the arrival of Allied forces. However, there was no official confirmation from the Japanese of the surrender. Soekarno and Hatta went to Yamamoto office to get the confirmation, but the office was empty. Then Ahmad Soebardjo went to meet Tadashi Maeda to ask about the surrender rumours, and received unofficial confirmation that the rumour was true. Hatta then asked Ahmad Soebardjo to arrange a meeting of the PPKI for the following day and went home to draft a proclamation. However, a group of youths, Wikana, Soebadio, Chaerul Saleh, Soekarni, Adam Malik, Darwis, and Soeroto Kunto went to Soekarno's house on Pegangsaan. Wikana demanded an immediate proclamation of independence in person, rather than through PPKI. Soekarno entrefused to do so as besides the need to discuss matters with the PPKI, he did not want to provoke the Japanese. Hatta subsequently arrived and took the same stance as Soekarno, and pointed out that there was still no official confirmation of the Japanese surrender. On August 16, 1945 at 3 a.m. the youths went to Soekarno's house again. They took Soekarno and Hatta to the town of Rengasdengklok. They forced them to declare independence as soon as possible. However, Soekarno and Hatta still refused. Later that morning, Maeda learned that Soekarno and Hatta had disappeared. An army investigation led to Wikana, who was pressured to return the two men to Jakarta. Then Kunto and Ahmad Soebardjo went to Rengasdengklok to pick up Soekarno and Hatta. On August 16, 1945 about 8 p.m. they arrived at Soekarno's house. Around midnight Soekarno and Hatta went to Maeda's house. There had been some people, such as Tampak Latuharhary, Otto Iskandardinata, Teuku Mohammad Hasan, and the youths such as Chaerul Saleh, Soekarni, B.M. Diah, and Sayuti Melik. Soekarno and Hatta created the declaration of independence. There was a debate about who would sign the proclamation text. Finally, they decided that Soekarno and Hatta signed the proclamation text. Soekarni stated that the proclamation text should be read in Ikada Field because they had announced people to gather there. However, the idea was rejected by Soekarno because they didn't want to cause an incident. Finally, Soekarno decided that the proclamation would be read at his house on Pegangsaan Timur Street 56 at 10 a.m. The proclamation text was typed by Sayuti Melik.​</h2><br />

                            10. The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence Indonesians celebrate their country's independence Day on August 17. The proclamation of Indonesian Independence took place on August 17, 1945. This is a historical moment. On August 12, 1945, Soekamo, Hatta, and Dr. Radjiman went to Dalat near Saigon to meet with the Japanese commander in the meeting. Japan planned to grant Indonesian Independence. On August 15, 1945 Japan buirender and Use Jaciarse authorities in the East Indies were ordered to maintain the status quo pending the arrival of allied forces. However, there was no official confirmation from the Japanese of the surrender. Soekamo and Hatta went to Yamamoto office to get the confirmation, but the office was empty. Then Ahmad Soebardjo went to meet Tadashi Maeda to ask about the surrender rumours, and received unofficial confirmation that the rumour was true. Hatta then asked Ahmad Soebardjo to arrange a meeting of the PPKI for the following day and went home to draft a proclamation. However, a group of youths, Wikana. Soebadio, Chaerul Saleh, Soekami, Adam Malik, Darwis, and Soeroto Kunto went to Soekamo's house on Pegangsaan. Wikana demanded an immediate proclamation of independence in person, rather than through PPKI. Soekamo refused to do so as besides the need to discuss matters with the PPKI, he did not want to provoke the Japanese. Hatta subsequently arrived and took the same stance as Soekamo, and pointed out that there was still no official confirmation of the Japanese surrender. On August 16, 1945 at 3 a.m. the youths went to Soekamo's house again. They took Soekarno and Hatta to the town of Rengasdengklok. They forced them to declare independence as soon as possible. However, Soekamo and Hatta still refused. Later that morning, Maeda leamed that Soekarno and Hatta had disappeared. An Army investigation led to Wikana, who was pressured to return the two men to Jakarta. Then Kunto and Ahmad Soebardjo went to Rengasdengklok to pick Soekamo and Hatta On August 16, 1945 about 8 p.m. they arrived at Soekarno's house. Around midnight Soekarnó and Hatta went to Maeda's house. There had been some people, such as Tampak Latuharhary, Otto Iskandardinata. Teuku Mohammad Hasan, and the youths such as Chaerul Saleh, Soekami, B.M. Diah, and Sayuti Melik. Soekarno and Hatta created the declaration of independence. There was a debate about who would sign the proclamation text. Finally, they decided that Soekamo and Hatta signed the proclamation text. Soekarni stated that the proclamation text should be read in Ikada Field because they had announced people to gather there. However, the idea was rejected by Soekamo because they didn't want to cause an incident. Finally, Soekarno decided that the proclamation would be read at his house on Pegangsaan Timur 56 at 10 a.m. The proclamation text was typed by Sayuti Melik On August 17, 1945 at 10 a.m. many people were worried because Hatta hadn't come yet. Five minutes later. Hatta came and people welcomed Soekarno and Hatta cheerfully. The ceremony was very simple. Soekarno with Hatta by his side, read the proclamation of Indonesian Independence. PETA officer, Latief Hendraningat, raised the red and white flag of Indonesia and the attendees sung the Indonesian national anthem, Indonesia Raya. The flag was sewed by Fatmawati, Soekarno's wife.

                            16. The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence Indonesians celebrate their country's independence Day on August 17. The proclamation of Indonesian Independence took place on August 17, 1945. This is a historical moment. On August 12, 1945, Soekamo, Hatta, and Dr. Radjiman went to Dalat near Saigon to meet with the Japanese commander in the meeting. Japan planned to grant Indonesian Independence. On August 15, 1945 Japan buirender and Use Jaciarse authorities in the East Indies were ordered to maintain the status quo pending the arrival of allied forces. However, there was no official confirmation from the Japanese of the surrender. Soekamo and Hatta went to Yamamoto office to get the confirmation, but the office was empty. Then Ahmad Soebardjo went to meet Tadashi Maeda to ask about the surrender rumours, and received unofficial confirmation that the rumour was true. Hatta then asked Ahmad Soebardjo to arrange a meeting of the PPKI for the following day and went home to draft a proclamation. However, a group of youths, Wikana. Soebadio, Chaerul Saleh, Soekami, Adam Malik, Darwis, and Soeroto Kunto went to Soekamo's house on Pegangsaan. Wikana demanded an immediate proclamation of independence in person, rather than through PPKI. Soekamo refused to do so as besides the need to discuss matters with the PPKI, he did not want to provoke the Japanese. Hatta subsequently arrived and took the same stance as Soekamo, and pointed out that there was still no official confirmation of the Japanese surrender. On August 16, 1945 at 3 a.m. the youths went to Soekamo's house again. They took Soekarno and Hatta to the town of Rengasdengklok. They forced them to declare independence as soon as possible. However, Soekamo and Hatta still refused. Later that morning, Maeda leamed that Soekarno and Hatta had disappeared. An Army investigation led to Wikana, who was pressured to return the two men to Jakarta. Then Kunto and Ahmad Soebardjo went to Rengasdengklok to pick Soekamo and Hatta On August 16, 1945 about 8 p.m. they arrived at Soekarno's house. Around midnight Soekarnó and Hatta went to Maeda's house. There had been some people, such as Tampak Latuharhary, Otto Iskandardinata. Teuku Mohammad Hasan, and the youths such as Chaerul Saleh, Soekami, B.M. Diah, and Sayuti Melik. Soekarno and Hatta created the declaration of independence. There was a debate about who would sign the proclamation text. Finally, they decided that Soekamo and Hatta signed the proclamation text. Soekarni stated that the proclamation text should be read in Ikada Field because they had announced people to gather there. However, the idea was rejected by Soekamo because they didn't want to cause an incident. Finally, Soekarno decided that the proclamation would be read at his house on Pegangsaan Timur 56 at 10 a.m. The proclamation text was typed by Sayuti Melik On August 17, 1945 at 10 a.m. many people were worried because Hatta hadn't come yet. Five minutes later. Hatta came and people welcomed Soekarno and Hatta cheerfully. The ceremony was very simple. Soekarno with Hatta by his side, read the proclamation of Indonesian Independence. PETA officer, Latief Hendraningat, raised the red and white flag of Indonesia and the attendees sung the Indonesian national anthem, Indonesia Raya. The flag was sewed by Fatmawati, Soekarno's wife.

                            29. The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence The proclamation of Indonesian independence was read at 10.00 a.m. on Friday, 17  August 1945. The declaration marked the start of the diplomatic and armed resistance of  the Indonesian National Revolution, fighting against the forces of the Netherlands and pro Dutch civilians, until the latter officially acknowledged Indonesia's independence in 1949.  In 2005, the Netherlands declared that they had decided to accept de facto 17 August 1945  as Indonesia's independence date. In a 2013 interview the Indonesian historian Sukotjo,  amongst others, asked the Dutch government to formally acknowledge the date of  independence as 17 August 1945. The United Nations, who mediated in the conflict,  formally acknowledge the date of independence as 27 December 1949.  The document was signed by Sukarno (who signed his name "Soekarno" using the older  Dutch orthography) and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed president and vice president respectively the following day.  The draft was prepared only a few hours earlier, on the night of 16 August, by Sukarno,  Hatta, and Soebardjo, at Rear-Admiral Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi's house, Miyako-Doori 1,  Jakarta (now the "Museum of the Declaration of Independence", JL. Imam Bonjol I, Jakarta).  The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik. Maeda  himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agreeable to the idea of Indonesia's  independence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. Marshal Terauchi,  the highest-ranking Japanese leader in South East Asia and son of Prime Minister Terauchi  Masatake, was however against Indonesia's independence, scheduled for 24 August. While the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself for  that matter, had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date  was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional  surrender to the Allies on 15 August following the Nagasaki atomic bombing. The historic  event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists such as Adam Malik  and Chairul Saleh, that’s put pressure on Sukarno and Hatta to proclaim independence  immediately. The declaration was to be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory  Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new  nation's diversity. The particular act was apparently inspired by a similar spirit of the  United States Declaration of Independence. However, the idea was heavily turned down by  the radical activists mentioned earlier, arguing that the committee was too closely  associated with then soon to be defunct Japanese occupation rule, thus creating a potential  credibility issue. Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them  were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed  on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co signers in the name of the nation of Indonesia. Sukarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada Plain, the large open  field in the centre of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread apprehension over the  possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venue was changed to Sukarno's house at Pegangsaan  Timur 56. There was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had  already surrendered to the Allies, the declaration of independence passed without a hitch. The proclamation at 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur, Jakarta, was heard throughout the  country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku radio station. An English translation of the  proclamation was broadcast overseas. Questions  4.  Write the social function of the text above! 5. What happened on 17 August 1945? 6.

                            34. The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence The proclamation of Indonesian independence was read at 10.00 a.m. on Friday, 17 August 1945. The document was signed by Sukarno (who signed his name "Soekarno" using the older Dutch orthography) and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed as president and vice-president respectively the following day. The draft was prepared only a few hours earlier, on the night of 16 August, by Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo, at Rear-Admiral Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi's house, Jalan Imam Bonjol I, Jakarta. The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik. Maeda agreed to the idea of Indonesia's independence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. While the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional surrender to the Allies on 15 August. The historic event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists such as Adam Malik and Chairul Saleh, that put pressure on Sukarno and Hatta to proclaim independence immediately. The declaration must be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new nation's diversity. Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co-signers in the name of the nation of Indonesia. Sukarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada plain, the large open field in the centre of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread apprehension over the possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venue was changed to Sukarno's house at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur 56 Jakarta. There was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had already surrendered to the Allies, The declaration of independence passed without a hitch. The proclamation at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur 56 Jakarta was heard throughout the country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku radio station. An English translation of the proclamation was broadcast overseas. 6. What is the text about? 7.

                        <strong>JAWABAN :</strong><strong>The text is about the proclamation of Indonesian independence on August 17, 1945, including the background, preparation, and details of the event.</strong><strong>The main idea of the last paragraph is that the proclamation of independence was heard throughout the country through a secret broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel, and an English translation was also broadcast overseas.</strong><strong>The underlined word "his" refers to Rear-Admiral Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi's house where the drafting of the declaration took place.</strong><strong>The underlined word "typed" has the same meaning as "written using a typewriter".</strong><strong>The word "evidence" in the fifth paragraph has the dissimilar meaning to "speculation" or "suspicion", as there was no concrete evidence to support the unfounded apprehension over the possibility of Japanese sabotage.</strong><strong>#JAWABANEDITHFAISAL</strong><strong>#BELAJARBERSAMABRAINLY</strong><br />
